# Machine Learning Regression Practice

This repository contains hands-on implementations of three core regression models using Python, scikit-learn, and seaborn:

### ✅ Included Models
- **Simple Linear Regression** → Predict salary based on years of experience.
- **Multiple Linear Regression** → Predict university admission chances using GRE, TOEFL, SOP, LOR, CGPA, research.
- **Logistic Regression** → Predict diabetes outcome (yes/no) using health data.

---

### 💥 Key Skills Practiced
- Data loading, preprocessing, and exploration
- Model building and training with scikit-learn
- Visualization with seaborn (`regplot`, `lmplot`, `pairplot`)
- Handling convergence warnings (`max_iter`)
- Evaluation metrics (MAPE, accuracy score)
- Plotting meaningful relationships and trends

### 🚀 Next Steps
- Add Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet regularization models
- Experiment with Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Improve visualizations and error analysis
