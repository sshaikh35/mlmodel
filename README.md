I’m excited to share that I’ve completed my first end-to-end machine learning project using Python and scikit-learn, building a Linear Regression model from scratch.

Through this project, I learned not just how to code a model, but also how to think like a data scientist. I explored and worked through the entire machine learning workflow, including:

- Importing and exploring the dataset
- Handling missing values and duplicates
- Preparing the features (X) and target (y)
- Understanding why features need to be structured as a DataFrame (using double brackets)
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Using `random_state` to ensure reproducibility in data splitting
- Training a Linear Regression model
- Making predictions on the test set
- Evaluating model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

This project helped me connect theoretical concepts with practical implementation, giving me a clear understanding of how machine learning models are built, trained, and evaluated.

I’m looking forward to building more models, experimenting with other algorithms, and improving performance through tuning and feature engineering.

If you have suggestions for beginner-friendly projects or advice on how to advance my skills, I would love to hear your thoughts.
